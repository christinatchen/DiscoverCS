# discoverCS

Program that allows users (Wellesley students) to navigate the current course offerings and prerequisites of the Wellesley College Computer Science department. Includes a 'Past' tab where users input all CS classes already taken, a 'Present' tab that lists all courses that the user can take immediately based on their past course input, a 'Future' tab that shows all the classes a user cannot immediately take and what is required to get there, and a 'Recommendations' tab that offers suggestions based on the user's interests, semester requirements, and course difficulty level through a decision tree. 

This was created as final project for CS230: Data Structures, and developed with two other teammates.
